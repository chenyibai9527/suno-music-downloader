[verse]
Ah, I broke the damn wheel, right outside a quiet farm,
Found a lil' diner, thought it'd calm my alarm.
Ordered up a burger, stressed "no pickles" with my plea,
Hoped for a quiet meal, just my thoughts an' me.

[verse]
Waited there quiet-like, as the cook worked the scene,
My burger arrived, looked perfect, juicy an' lean.
But as I took that first big bite, somethin' wasn't quite right,
Eager to discover, here's what came to light.

[chorus]
Oh, a pickle in my burger, what a cruel surprise,
A sneaky trick, hidden right before my eyes.
Next time I’ll say it loud, ensure they know my vice,
Keep those pickles out, they ain’t nothing nice.

[verse]
Marched right up to the cashier, to state my case,
Said, "I ordered no pickles," with a frown upon my face.
Then hear this, they told me, "No refunds, that's the deal,"
How do I explain, this unwanted meal?

[chorus]
Oh, a pickle in my burger, what a cruel surprise,
A sneaky trick, hidden right before my eyes.
Next time I’ll say it loud, ensure they know my vice,
Keep those pickles out, they ain’t nothing nice.

[verse]
Now here I pause, not a dime to my name,
Broke and hungry, just wanted a meal, what a shame.
With an empty belly, feelin' pretty low,
All I asked for was a simple lunch, no fuss to show.

[chorus]
Oh, a pickle in my burger, what a cruel surprise,
A sneaky trick, hidden right before my eyes.
Next time I’ll say it loud, ensure they know my vice,
Keep those pickles out, they ain’t nothing nice.

NO MORE PICKLE!
