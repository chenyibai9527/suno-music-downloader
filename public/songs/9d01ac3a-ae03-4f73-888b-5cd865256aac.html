Heres to the real ones.
Heres to the long time coming!
heres for all our hard work to, just, get, BY!

[Pre chorus]

howw come after all this it's still a struggle?
where's the satisfaction at the end,
that was promised at the start of all this!

[Chorus]
We, Are, Working!
non stop till our hearts drop!
till, we, get, sick searching for an end
wheres it end!!! 20 years starting to get concerning just keeps on reoccurring!
We, Are, Working! (Working!)

[verse 2]
Prices rise and we fall,
wheres the end of it all?
Gas is at high
foods out of reach
is starvation till we die or is it work as far as the eye can see whens it end?
ohhhhh
