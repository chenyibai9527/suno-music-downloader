(Wow, what a beautiful day... let's have a cook out!)

[Intro]

[Versa]
A sunny summer day
Gonna light up the grill.
Got my burgers sizzling
Gonna give you a thrill.
A taste so good, juicy patty of meat,  
mmm, Burgers are the best food to eat.

[Record scratch]

[Verse]
Hold up, hold up,
What did you say?
You really think hamburgers are so great? 
What's wrong with you? Did you get hit in the head?
Hotdogs are the greatest to grill. (You heard what I said!)


[Pre-chorus]
(uh-oh, its on.... grill wars!)


[Chorus]
Hotdogs, hamburgers, who will be king?
In this backyard battle, who will reign supreme...
Epic battle between burgers and dogs,
Which do you choose? and who will be wrong?

[Short saxophone break]

[Verse]
Burgers are versatile
You can stack patties higher and bigger than the Eiffel Tower.
Add tons of toppings, change 'em all up
Create any flavour profile you can think of. 

[Short break]

[Verse]
No hard feelings, but I respectfully disagree,
You’re just masking the taste with all those toppings.
Dogs are great plain, with a bun or without, man.
Drink a beer while you eat, cause' you hold 'em in one hand.

[Interlude]



[Interlude]

[Bridge, rap]
Time for a cook off
To see who is best
Burgers or dogs
Let’s put it to a taste test

[Long Saxophone solo]

[Outro]
This is stupid y’all
There won't be winners or losers
At the end of the day, we got bellies full of food!
Enjoy the sun, the great company too
Be grateful, love all food...
(You do you!)

(Peace and love)
(Backyard barbecue)
(Burgers and dogs living in harmony)

(Backyard barbecue)
(Burgers and dogs living in harmony)
