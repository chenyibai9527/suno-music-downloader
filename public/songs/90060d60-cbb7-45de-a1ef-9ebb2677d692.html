    <meta name="keywords" content="🦖🦕☄️🔥,Stei Camel 🐪,(Verse 1)
In a time long past, on Earth's dark stage,
A saga of shadows, an ominous page.
Colossal beasts, ruling the land,
In eerie harmony, a sinister band.

(Chorus)
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.

(Verse 2)
Volcanoes roared, spewing their wrath,
Darkness descended, blocking the path.
Ash filled the air, choking the light,
Day turned to night, a never-ending night.

(Chorus)
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.

(Bridge)
For eons they reigned, the rulers of old,
But fate had a plan, a story untold.
The meteor's kiss, a final embrace,
Bringing an end to their ancient grace.

(Verse 1)
In ages past, on Earth's grim stage,
A tale of might, of primal rage.
Colossal beings, lords of the land,
In ancient silence, their dominion planned.

[Break]

(Chorus)
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.

(Verse 2)
Volcanoes roared, spewing their wrath,
Darkness descended, blocking the path.
Ash filled the air, choking the light,
Day turned to night, a never-ending night.

[Break]

(Chorus)
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.


(Verse 2)
Volcanoes roared, spewing their wrath,
Darkness descended, blocking the path.
Ash filled the air, choking the light,
Day turned to night, a never-ending night.

[Break]

(Chorus)
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.

[Bridge]
In epochs draped with sorrow's shroud,
Their sovereignty, a fleeting cloud.
The meteor's descent, a mournful embrace,
Sealed their fate in time's relentless race.

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, a tear in the eye.
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.

[Outro]
[Ending]
Now in the depths, their legacy remains,
Echoes of loss under desolate plains.
Though gone, their memory a haunting refrain,
In the bleakness of time, forever stained.

[End]

(But then came the fire from the sky,
A celestial dance, dinosaurs running in fear,
The impact fierce, the world did shake,
And thus began the great earthquake.)
