We begin our journey in the land of metal.

If you look out to the right, you will see a demon riding a dragon wielding a sword, breathing fire. Please pull down the fire proof curtains for safety.

We are now exiting the inferno, you may raise the curtains.

Next we pass through the cassical meadows. Out the window you may view grand ornate concert halls, with pianos and stringed instruments littering the landscape. Relax and enjoy.

Wake up, we're on a journey through the city of rap,
Where every street corner tells a story, every beat a trap.
Graffiti murals paint the walls with vibrant tales,
While DJs on the corner spin records, setting sails.

Block parties erupt with energy, the crowd in sync,
As emcees drop bars, making the pavement shrink.
Skyscrapers pierce the sky, symbolizing dreams,
From humble beginnings to platinum-selling regimes.

Landmarks like the mic in the spotlight's glare,
Where legends spit fire, showing they truly care.
As we roll through the neighborhoods, feel the vibe,
In this city of rap, where culture thrives and tribes collide.

In alleyways, young talents hone their craft,
Dreaming of the day they'll rise to the top, and laugh.
From the underground scene to mainstream acclaim,
The city of rap embraces all, each with a name.

Street vendors sell mixtapes, hustling with pride,
Entrepreneurs in their own right, riding the tide.
And as the train rolls on, the beat never dies,
In this city of rap, where every lyric flies.

[beat break]

Please return to your seats as we enter the country fields.



Hop aboard, through the heart of the country we ride,
Fields and farms stretch wide, where dreams abide.

Past barns and homesteads, painted in hues so bright,
Underneath the Southern sky, everything feels right.
As the train chugs along, through valleys and hills,
In this land of simple beauty, time stands still.



Leave the cow and come back aboard as we venture through the depths of emo's domain,
Down to the basements where emotions run like rain.
Glimpse through the windows, see hundreds of weeping men,
Grab your umbrellas, for tears might splash again.

Darkened rooms with walls adorned in black,
Echoes of heartache, in every chord and track.
Through the shadows, where emotions flow so raw,
In these emo basements, where broken hearts draw.



Umbrellas down, everyone.

Feel the rhythm as we journey through the land of reggae,
Where the vibes are irie and the music's never vague.
Through streets lined with palm trees, hear drums and bass,
As we pass through reggae's homeland, feel the soulful embrace.

From the birthplace of the beat to shores kissed by the sea,
Reggae's spirit thrives, setting hearts and minds free.
In this tropical paradise, where the music's always sweet,
Let the reggae rhythm move you, from your head down to your feet.



Hold on tight as we cruise through the pop punk zone,
Where skateboards fly and rebellion's set in stone.
Through suburban streets with graffiti-tagged walls,
Passengers beware, this ride's gonna have some thralls.

Catch a glimpse of kids with colorful hair and chains,
Lip piercings gleaming as they ride through the lanes.
Blasts of power chords and anthems of youth,
In this pop punk territory, where rebellion finds its truth.



Brace yourselves as we enter the realm of black metal's dread,
Where darkness reigns and echoes of the dead.
Through mist-covered forests and ancient castle walls,
Feel the chill of the dungeon's haunting calls.

Gothic spires pierce the sky, shrouded in gloom,
As we journey deeper into the metal's tomb.
Screams of guitars and thunderous drums resound,
In this black metal dungeon, where darkness is crowned.

From cryptic lyrics to infernal screams that pierce the night,
In the depths of this dungeon, where shadows take flight.
So steel your hearts and brace for what's ahead,
In the black metal abyss, where the brave and the bold are led.

In the depths of this dungeon, where shadows take flight.
So steel your hearts and brace for what's ahead,
In the black metal abyss, where the brave and the bold are led.



Enough of this grim stuff, time to party with a roar,
As we dive into the chaos of thrash metal galore.
Riffing guitars and pounding drums, the energy's insane,
In this mosh pit madness, let loose and embrace the pain.

From keg stands to headbanging, the rules are out the door,
In this metal mayhem, where we let our spirits soar.
So raise your horns and bang your head, let the madness unfurl,
In this thrash metal world, where we rule.

[fiddle solo]

[fiddle solo]

Amidst tranquil forests, where ancient trees stand tall,
We journey through folk music's gentle call.
Hear melodies in the breeze, tales from troubadours,
In this woodland symphony, where nature's spirit soars.

[beat drop]
